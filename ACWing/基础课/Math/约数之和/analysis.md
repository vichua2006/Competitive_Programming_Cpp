### For any integer $n = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdot p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdot p_3^{\alpha_3}...p_k^{\alpha_k}$, the sum of its factors equals: $$(p_1^0 + p_1^1 + p_1^2+...+p_1^{\alpha_1})(...)(p_k^0 + p_k^1 + p_k^2+...+p_k^{\alpha_k})$$
### The expansion of this expression results the summing of all possible combinations of its prime factors, which is, namely, all of its factors.
